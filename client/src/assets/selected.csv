Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse[BREAK][BREAK]meal (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary, add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds.[BREAK]Turn the dough onto your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour. [BREAK][BREAK]After the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  Fold the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5 cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling. [BREAK][BREAK]Remove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm) circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4 inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. [BREAK][BREAK]Make the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar, and ground cinnamon. [BREAK][BREAK]Remove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust. Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.[BREAK][BREAK]Remove the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil, on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)[BREAK][BREAK]Place the pie plate on the hot baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color and the fruit juices begin to bubble.[BREAK][BREAK]Remove the pie from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for several hours.

Add the sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages and keep hot on a plate in the oven.[BREAK]Snip a few small cuts into the fatty edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for 2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.[BREAK]For the mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.[BREAK]For the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding their shape.[BREAK]For the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1Â½-2 minutes each side until slightly crispy.[BREAK]For 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for 2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn the slice.[BREAK]For the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted.

Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.[BREAK][BREAK]STEP 2[BREAK]Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise.

Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.[BREAK][BREAK]STEP 8[BREAK]Cover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.[BREAK][BREAK]STEP 9[BREAK]Tip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.[BREAK][BREAK]STEP 10[BREAK]TO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.[BREAK][BREAK]STEP 11[BREAK]Make into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.""","Sushi","https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/g046bb1663960946.jpg","{""strMeasure12"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure13"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure10"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure11"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure20"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure9"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure7"":{""S"":""1""},""strMeasure8"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure5"":{""S"":""1 tbs""},""strMeasure6"":{""S"":""1 tbs""},""strMeasure3"":{""S"":""2 tbs""},""strMeasure4"":{""S"":""3 tbs""},""strMeasure1"":{""S"":""300ml ""},""strMeasure18"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure2"":{""S"":""100ml""},""strMeasure19"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure16"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure17"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure14"":{""S"":"" ""},""strMeasure15"":{""S"":"" ""}}","https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/simple-sushi","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub68OxEypaY"

To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins â€“ when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.[BREAK]For the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but donâ€™t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.[BREAK]To assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.[BREAK]Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.[BREAK]Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.[BREAK]Assemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.

Next add the can of tomatoes, the water or stock, and carrots. Let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until the veg is tender and the mixture has thickened up. Youâ€™ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and a top of of liquid if needed.[BREAK]Add the lentils and chopped roasted squash.

Begin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh water, until a creamy consistency is reached. You may need to add less or more water to reach the desired consistency.[BREAK]Add a pinch of sea salt and vinegar (or lemon juice).""","Smoky Lentil Chili with Squash","https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uwxqwy1483389553.jpg","{""strMeasure12"":{""S"":""1 can""},""strMeasure13"":{""S"":""3 cups""},""strMeasure10"":{""S"":""1 tsp""},""strMeasure11"":{""S"":""1/2 tsp""},""strMeasure20"":{""S"":""""},""strMeasure9"":{""S"":""1 tsp""},""strMeasure7"":{""S"":""1 tsp""},""strMeasure8"":{""S"":""1/2 tsp""},""strMeasure5"":{""S"":""4 tsp ground ""},""strMeasure6"":{""S"":""2 tsp ground""},""strMeasure3"":{""S"":""1 chopped""},""strMeasure4"":{""S"":""3 cloves""},""strMeasure1"":{""S"":""1 tbls""},""strMeasure18"":{""S"":""1 Cup""},""strMeasure2"":{""S"":""1""},""strMeasure19"":{""S"":""1 tsp""},""strMeasure16"":{""S"":""1 tsp""},""strMeasure17"":{""S"":""1 Small""},""strMeasure14"":{""S"":""3 chopped""},""strMeasure15"":{""S"":""1 1/2 cups""}}","http://www.wholeheartedeats.com/2016/11/smoky-lentil-chili-squash/","Pulse","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKmqawK2Tqs"

Work everything together in the pan and push it down so that the mixture covers the base of the pan â€“ allow the mixture to catch slightly on the base of the pan before turning it over and doing the same again.
